# proxy
Free source anti-detection browser based on Chromium
Hundreds of new identities just in one click
The browser has systems for protection and fingerprint substitution (GPU, Audio, Canvas, Plugins, Fonts, ClientRects, Ubercookies) automatically changing them for each new identity. Nobody can recognize configuration of your real computer if you surf with ProxyLuxe – it protects you against any identification attempt.


AES-256 encryption
The browser uses the best protected type of data encryption to keep safe information saved to the computer in case of necessity. Besides, you can import identities with necessary data safely.


Portable format
Portable format of the software allows using it where it is necessary without installing it to the computer. You can easily run ProxyLuxe from a protected drive or from a private section of the computer – it is the most secure solution among the all-in-one browsers existing today.


OTR-mode
ProxyLuxe operates in Off-the-Record mode – during software operation all current files and data are saved in RAM till its closure. Thus, it is impossible to get access to information about visited sites and activities in them even using spying solutions (viruses) installed directly on the computer.


Anonymity in the Internet
The software allows you easily substitute your IP-address using, e.g., TOR. The users who do not trust an onion network can make use of multiflow SOCKS and SSH connections. You are everywhere and nowhere at the same time.


Absence of spying code
ProxyLuxe is designed using Chromium core, but it is totally devoid of all elements of Google spying code, which is impossible to completely delete or disable in any out-of-box browser solutions. Be sure of your own safety and anonymity.
